buy with positive impact

##elevator pitch
Every time you buy something, you are in the middle of a massive chain reaction, involving millions of living things.
Wouldn't it be great if you had more awareness of the inner workings of this chain?
Wouldn't it be even better if, as an active participant in the chain, you could actually create a measurable positive impact?

This is what GoodKarmaCard is all about. It's a loyalty program with a meaning: every time you buy something from our partner, you create a positive impact. Impact that you can see, understand and direct towards the causes that you care most about.
